#For this project, we have used the dataset available from ‘Walmart Store Sales Forecasting’ project that was available on Kaggle. 
#In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. 
#In addition, we had store and geography specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns etc. 
#Using these factors, we needed to develop a regression model that can forecast the sales and is also computationally efficient and scalable.
